WebScraper
==========
This is a web scraping program that will log in to the University of Minnesota Moodle website and compare current grades to the grades at the last time they were checked.  If they have been changed, an email will be sent with the updated grade values.  There are a few hardcoded segments right now for the Moodle layout, but that is the next thing to be fixed.  Basic applet as well that displays the time of the last check and grades at the time.
