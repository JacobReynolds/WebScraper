WebScraper
==========
This is a web scraping program that will log in to the University of Minnesota Moodle website and compare current grades to the grades at the last time they were checked.  If they have been changed, an email will be sent with the updated grade values.  Due to the HTML set up of Moodle, the user's layout must look similar to <a href="http://imgur.com/GA0Ux0R">this</a>.  The applet interface will take in the user's x500 and password, along with their Gmail address and password.

All comments beginning with //--- are comments for the user describing basic functions.
